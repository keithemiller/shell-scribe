      <h3>What is Shell-Scribe?</h3>
      <p>Shell-Scribe is an elegant solution to a common problem.  It's a smart logger that not only records what you write, but warns you when it fails while running.</p>
      <p>Imagine this: there's a new configuration for a program that you want to install.  Wouldn't it be nice if, instead of just a .sh, the developer of the configuration was virtually guiding you through installation?  Wouldn't it also be nice if that person was easily accessable the second you had an issue arise in installation?  As a developer utilizing Shell-Scribe you have the power to create dynamic scripts that are easy for people to read and follow.  Shell-Scribe will take comments from the developer about their code, and automatically generate a tutorial on the instalation.  In addition to generating an installation tutorial, should the installer run into any errors upon configuring, a text message will be automatically sent to the developer to let them know that the code failed and where it failed using Twilio.</p>
      <h4>With Shell-Scribe, the future of configuration is here!</h4>
